I am a researcher in educational sciences. My main interest is the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that can help teachers better supporting their students. I wonder **how to build, aggregate and disseminate data from educational experiments in order to inform teaching practices**.

Current situtaion
======
I have currently a post-doc position at Laboratoire de Recherches sur les Apprentissages en Contexte ([LaRAC](https://www.larac.fr)) at Université Grenoble Alpes. I am leading a research project to perform a critical analysis of the way meta-analyses are undertaken in education, with a particular interest in how meta-analyses take (or do not take) into account the heterogeneity of studies when aggregating their results.


Short bio
=====
Trained as an engineer, I obtained my PhD in Public Health and Epidemiology at Université Paris Descartes in 2017. My thesis questioned the mismatch between medical research efforts and public health priorities worldwide. 

During 2018 - 2024 I was a Research Fellow at the Learning Planet Institute (formerly CRI-Paris) - Université Paris Descartes, where I created and coordinated the **[Profs-Chercheurs programme](https://profschercheurs.org)**. Profs-Chercheurs is a programme based on citizen science and collective intelligence to support educators in tackling common professional challenges, through the use of research methods and a dedicated collaborative platform.
