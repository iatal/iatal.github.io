I am a researcher in educational sciences. My main interest is the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that can help teachers better supporting their students. I wonder **how to build, aggregate and disseminate data from educational experiments in order to inform teaching practices**.

Short bio
=====
Trained as an engineer, I obtained my PhD in Public Health and Epidemiology at Paris Descartes University in 2017. My thesis questioned the mismatch between medical research efforts and public health priorities worldwide. 

I then obtained a Long-term research fellowship (2018-2024) at the Learning Planet Institute (formerly CRI-Paris), where I created and coordinated the [Profs-Chercheurs programme](https://profschercheurs.org). Profs-Chercheurs is a programme based on citizen science and collective intelligence to support educators in tackling common professional challenges, through the use of research methods and a dedicated collaborative platform. 

Since December 2024 I joined LaRAC to lead a critical analysis of the way meta-analyses are undertaken in education, with a particular interest in how meta-analyses take (or not) into account the heterogeneity of studies when aggregating their results.
